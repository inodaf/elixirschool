Welcome, Bem-vindo, Bienvenido!

We're happy to share with you the all new Elixir School blog, Appendix!
As part of our 2018 initiatives to bring you even more awesomeness at Elixir School we're rolling out some exciting new changes.
In this post we'll outline some of those changes and some of the exciting ways _you_ can get involved.

### Appendix

Through our blog we hope you'll follow along with our different projects, join us for deep dives into Elixir, explore functional programming concepts, and discover new topics and libraries not covered in our lessons.
If that's not enough to get you excited then here's a sneak peek at some of the topics we've got in store for you:

+ How to deploy Elixir projects using OTP releases
+ On-going series outlining the latest changes in Elixir
+ Deep dives into topics like testing and concurrency
+ Exploration of different libraries and projects
+ Reviews of books and other learning materials
+ Plus a wide range of Elixir tips, tricks, and best practices

What could make this blog even better? __You__!
Elixir School wouldn't be what it is today without the contributions of people such as yourself and this blog is no exception.
As part of our initiative to encourage open source contributions and lower the barrier to educational resources, we want to welcome you and others to share the insights, experiences, and knowledge you've gained in your Elixir journey.
If writing for Elixir School is something that interest you, create [Issues](https://github.com/elixirschool/elixirschool/issues) the each topics you'd like to suggest!

### Extracurricular

We launched Extracurricular in early September 2017 with a goal to make it easier to become a contributor to Elixir open source projects.
Our primary goal has always been to provide a way for new users to discover Elixir, learn it, and find ways to contribute back.
Extracurricular was no exception and we were excited to see the early adoption and usage.  But as is with some things usage has dropped off in recent months which caused us to answer some questions about how we want to spend our limited resources.

We're making the tough decision to shutter Extracurricular for the time being to focus on other efforts we think will deliver greater value, like Appendix.

Is this the end of Extracurricular?
Probably not but we need step back, gather our thoughts and figure out a better approach, and maybe a different product altogether.

### Sponsorship

Another big change to Elixir School is the arrival of  sponsors.
Elixir School has always been a free ad-free resource and always will be but that has limited some of the projects we can undertake.
We've thought long and hard about this, evening going so far as to discuss it with some of organizations that have approached us.

Through sponsorship we'll be empowered to encourage and help fund global Elixir events, dedicate resources to growing our collection of lessons and articles, in addition to working with conferences and publishers provide readers with discounts and give-aways.

If you're interested in sponsoring Elixir School we'd love to hear from you!

Stay tuned — this is just the beginning of a very exciting year for the Elixir School team.
